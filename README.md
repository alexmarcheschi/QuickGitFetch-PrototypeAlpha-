# QuickGitFetch-PrototypeAlpha-
This is a plugin compatible with UnrealEngine 5.1.1. It adds in the toolbar a github icon, when clicked it will automatically push all the committed files. without running commands, also when the project starts it will automatically synchronize the last change published (NOTE: it is still a prototype, so it can give some problems or not working)
